# Applied-Data-Science-Project

This is IBM Applied data science project for spaceX, In this project a prediction is needed if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not. According to the backdrop SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million
dollars;
